# A/B test for an online learning product

During the testing of a hypothesis, a new payment mechanism was proposed to the target group on the website, while the control group retained the basic mechanism. The task at hand is to analyze the experiment results and determine whether to launch the new payment mechanism for all users.

The research aimed to address the following questions:

- What metrics can be examined during the analysis?
- Are there any differences in the metrics, and what could they be attributed to?
- Are these differences statistically significant?
- Should the new mechanism be launched for all users?

Finally, it was necessary to develop a function that would retrieve additional data from the cloud, updating the metrics, and another function to visualize the differences in metrics between the test and control groups.

All the assignment tasks are solved and conclusions documented within the Jupyter Notebook.
